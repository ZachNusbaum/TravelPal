# Project Notes

## What I would have done differently

* I would have organized the components for ride share comparison feature into their own module (like i did with the places feature).
E.g. i would have placed app/lyft-prices, app/price-lists, app/uber-prices, app/lyft-prices, and app/ride-share form into app/ride-share/...

## Things to still do:

* Cache API responses
